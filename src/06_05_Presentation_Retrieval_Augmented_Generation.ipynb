        "\n",
        "[Meta AI introduced the RAG method](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/), emphasizing its potential for knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔍 **1. What is RAG?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, boosts large language models (LLMs) by tapping into external knowledge sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Meta AI pioneered RAG to tackle knowledge-heavy tasks efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Combines info retrieval with text generation, enabling LLMs to access fresh, reliable info.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ideal for tasks needing accurate, current data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🤔 **2. Why RAG was developed?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- LLMs excel in mimicking human text but face limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- High training/fine-tuning costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Knowledge is static, outdated post-training.\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"Hallucinating\" issue: confidently giving wrong info.\n",
        "\n",
        "- RAG overcomes these by merging LLM prowess with real-time data access.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. 🛠️ **3. How RAG Works?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- On receiving a query (like a question), RAG fetches relvant documents/passages from external sources (like Wikipedia).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Blends these retrieved docs with the query to create an enriched context. This is then processed by a text generator (e.g., GPT-3) to generate the final answer.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 🌟 **4. Key Features of RAG:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- RAG stays current, accessing the latest info, unlike static-knowledge LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integrates fresh info without the high cost of retraining the whole LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sources reliable info, reducing wrong answers or \"hallucinations.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "- Answering evolving topic questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Useful in domains needing real-time accuracy (e.g., medical, legal).\n",

Many teams worldwide compete in this area, striving for state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.The team had a singular goal: to develop an object detection model to distinguish itself in a highly competitive space. The team understood that even incremental improvements could be groundbreaking, like sprinters working on shaving milliseconds off their times. In their relentless pursuit of pushing the boundaries of performance, they embraced the challenge, knowing that each incremental increase in mAP and reduction in latency could revolutionize the landscape of object detection models.As a team, we also had a secondary aim: demonstrating the capabilities of Deci's AutoNAC engine and bringing exposure to SuperGradients, our powerful, intuitive, and unparalleled training library.¬†And if these graphs indicate anything, we‚Äôve done a good job of what we set out to do.YOLO-NAS compared to previous SOTA on COCOSuperGradients star historyDesigning the BlueprintInspired by the success of modern YOLO architectures, our team set out to create a new quantization-friendly architecture - and it all started with Neural Architecture Search (NAS).NAS:Everything You Need to KnowThe first thing you need to do when performing Neural Architecture Search is define the architecture search space. For YOLO-NAS, our researchers took inspiration from the basic blocks of YOLOv6 and YOLOv8. With the architecture and training regime in place, our researchers harnessed the power of AutoNAC. It intelligently searched a vast space of ~10^14 possible architectures, ultimately zeroing in on three final networks that promised outstanding results. The result is a family of architectures with a novel quantization-friendly basic block: the small, medium, and large versions of YOLO-NAS.With the foundation of YOLO-NAS firmly established, the team was ready to embark on the next critical phase: perfecting the training regime to ensure the full potential of these innovative architectures could be realized.Interested in the technical details of YOLO-NAS? Read the technical blog post.Read the Technical Blog PostPerfecting the Training RegimeThe team devised an advanced and innovative training scheme incorporating several elements, each carefully crafted to extract maximum performance from the model:Pretraining on the extensive Object365 dataset.Employing pseudo-labelled data to enhance learning.Applying knowledge distillation from a pre-trained teacher model to improve performance.After completing the training process, post-training quantization (PTQ) was applied, converting the network into INT8.¬†Testing the Model's VersatilityTo demonstrate the prowess of YOLO-NAS, we tested it on the RoboFlow 100 collection, a diverse dataset ranging from video games to aerial images.Our model outperformed close competitors like YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, proving its potential as a versatile and powerful foundation for transfer learning.Overcoming Quantization ChallengesQuantization-aware training (QAT) can enhance a model's efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, but it's far from a walk in the park.¬†Learn more about QAT hereIt requires quantization-friendly model components, intricate infrastructure, and precise adjustments to settings and hyperparameters. Thankfully, our model was designed with QAT in mind, and SuperGradients' user-friendly interface and expert guidance, we not only overcame these challenges but also improved our model's efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.Tired of all the talk? Want to see YOLO-NAS in action?  Check out this getting started notebook I‚Äôve put together for you.See YOLO-NAS in action!The LaunchpadI‚Äôm proud of the team‚Äôs achievements and the potential of YOLO-NAS, but our journey doesn't end here. As we continue to explore the boundaries of object detection (and deep learning in general), we remain committed to pushing the limits and sharing our progress with you. Our model may not remain unbeatable forever, but our unwavering determination to stay ahead of the curve will keep us on the cutting edge of this dynamic field.We‚Äôre not resting on our laurels. We rely on your support to enhance the object detection game. To achieve this, I urge you to subject YOLO-NAS and SuperGradients to stress tests, push them to their limits, and attempt to break them. Should you encounter any issues or have questions, all you have to do is open an issue on GitHub. SuperGradients is an open-source library, and if you're interested in contributing, please review our contribution guidelines. I hope this behind-the-scenes look at our efforts has piqued your interest and inspired you to follow our journey. Stay tuned for more exciting updates, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.

Deci's AutoNAC engine harnesses this technology to intelligently search through an immense space of possible architectures, enabling the creation of optimized and novel neural network designs without the extensive computational resources traditionally required. This process leads to the development of high-performing models, such as the DeciCoder-6B and the YOLO-NAS, by efficiently finding the best architecture among potentially trillions of options.\"}"
