Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.\n","Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\", together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning.
