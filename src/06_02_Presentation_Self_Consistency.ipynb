This can be solved by first finding how many computers were installed in total from Monday to Thursday, then adding that to the initial nine computers in the room.\\n\\nStep 1: Find the number of computers installed from Monday to Thursday:\\nSince five more computers were installed each day, we can add five to the total number of computers each day. Therefore, the number of computers installed each day is 5, 10, 15, and 20 for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday respectively. Adding these numbers together, we get a total of 50 computers installed from Monday to Thursday.\\n\\nStep 2: Add the initial nine computers to the total number installed:\\nWe know that there were initially nine computers in the server room, so we add that to the 50 computers installed from Monday to Thursday.
