        "\n",
        "- Zero-shot CoT prompting helps LLMs solve complex problems in one go, without needing specific examples. Simply add \"Let's think step by step\" to the prompt.1\n",
        "\n",
        "- Zero-shot-CoT is great but falls short sometimes with calculation errors, missing steps, and semantic misunderstandings.\n",

While Zero-shot-CoT encourages LLMs to generate multi-step reasoning with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù, it may still generate wrong reasoning steps when the problem is complex. Unlike Zero-shot-CoT, PS prompting first asks LLMs to devise a plan to solve the problem by generating a step-bystep plan and carrying out the plan to find the answer.</figcaption>\n",
