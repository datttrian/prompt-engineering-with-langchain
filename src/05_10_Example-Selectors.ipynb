It's a type of example selector that leverages embeddings and a vector store to find the most semantically similar examples.\n","\n","### Attributes:\n","\n","1. **vectorstore**: An instance of `VectorStore` that contains information about the examples. This is where the embeddings of the examples are stored and queried.\n","2. **k**: The number of examples to select. By default, it's set to 4.\n","3. **example_keys**: Optional keys to filter the examples. If provided, only these keys will be considered when selecting examples.\n","4. **input_keys**: Optional keys to filter the input. If provided, the search is based on these input variables instead of considering all variables.\n","\n","### Methods:\n","\n","1. **`add_example(example: Dict[str, str]) -> str`**:\n","   - Adds a new example to the `vectorstore`.\n","   - If `input_keys` are provided, it constructs a string representation of the example using only those keys. Otherwise, it uses all keys.\n","   - The constructed string is then added to the `vectorstore`, and the ID of the added text is returned.\n","\n","2. **`select_examples(input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]`**:\n","   - Selects examples based on their semantic similarity to the provided input variables.\n","   - Constructs a query string from the input variables.\n","   - Uses the `vectorstore` to search for the most similar examples to the query.\n","   - Retrieves the actual examples from the metadata of the search results.\n","   - If `example_keys` are provided, the returned examples are filtered to include only those keys.\n","\n","3. **`from_examples(...)`**:\n","   - A class method that creates an instance of `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector`.\n","   - Initializes the `vectorstore` with the provided examples and embeddings.\n","   - Returns an instance of `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` with the initialized `vectorstore`.\n","\n","### How It Works:\n","\n","- The class leverages embeddings to represent the semantic meaning of examples and input variables.\n","- When you want to select examples that are semantically similar to a given input, you provide the input variables to the `select_examples` method.\n","- The method then queries the `vectorstore` to find the most similar examples based on their embeddings.\n","- The returned examples can be filtered based on `example_keys` if provided.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"EzVMuncBvsEu"},"outputs":[],"source":["examples"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WrVh7XVHt0Sh"},"outputs":[],"source":["example_prompt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VnKZHOjKt4Bu"},"outputs":[],"source":["example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(\n","    examples,\n","    OpenAIEmbeddings(),\n","    FAISS,\n","    k=4\n",")\n","similar_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\n","    # We provide an ExampleSelector instead of examples.\n","    example_selector=example_selector,\n","    example_prompt=example_prompt,\n","    prefix=\"Translate yon modern utterance into the tongue of the Bard\",\n","    suffix=\"Modern: {sentence}\\nShakespearean:\",\n","    input_variables=[\"sentence\"]\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"rhPHqoiwt6m4"},"outputs":[],"source":["print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence=\"What does it mean when someone says they're 'Throwing shade' at another?\"))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"HL3pPfNVuYpi"},"outputs":[],"source":["print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence=\"Someone told me my style was reminiscent of a 'snack'.
